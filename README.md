# Stooge-sort-analysis-
Analysis of the stooge sort running times
The program generates several arrays with random integers and measures time needed to sort with with Stooge algorithm.
Implemented in C.
Plan for the future: 1. have more arrays generated for more accurate results, and printing it into file.
                     2. find out why with increasing array size there are flat-out intervals in the running time. Shouldn't it increase all                         the time? There should be some mathematical explanation
                     3. modify the program so it will take in any algorithm and will run series of time tests on it.
